scientists set sequence for chromosome linked to early-stage low iq
( afp report from paris , january 2 ) a group of international scientists said that they had set the sequence for human being's chromosome 14 , which is linked to many diseases including the early-stage alzheimer people in their 30s may have .
this is so far the fourth chromosome to be fully sequenced , which is made up of over 87 million dna .
the study on the british science weekly shows that chromosome 14 comprises of 1,050 genes and gene segments .
the aim of gene scientists is to offer diagnostic tools to discover flawed genes that lead to diseases and finally provide treatments that can prevent the genes from malfunctioning .
scientists led by french gene research center , genoscope , said that chromosome 14 has two groups of gene linked to immune system and over 60 kinds of disease gene .
chromosome 14 has been identified in earlier researches on many diseases , which include children's spastic paraplegia , missing teeth , several kinds of sight and hearing damages and the early-stage alzheimer .
there are about 200,000 people with alzheimer in the early state in the united states , accounting for 5 % of all the alzheimer patients in the country .
human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
over the past three years , three pairs of chromosomes have been sequenced including the 20th , 21st and 22nd .
