scientists complete sequencing of the chromosome linked to early dementia
( afp , paris , january 2 ) an international team of scientists said that they have completed the sequencing of human chromosome 14 that is linked to many diseases , including the early-onset alzheimer's that may strike people in their 30s .
this is the fourth chromosome whose sequence has been completed to date . it comprises more than 87 million pairs of dna .
this study published in the weekly british scientific journal nature illustrates that the sequence of chromosome 14 comprises 1,050 genes and gene fragments .
the goal of geneticists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify defective genes that cause diseases so as to arrive eventually at treatments that can prevent those genes from malfunctioning .
the international scientists led by genoscope , a french gene research center , said that chromosome 14 contains two clusters of genes that are linked to the function of our immune system and more than 60 disease genes .
chromosome 14 has been identified in earlier studies on a great number of diseases such as spastic paraplegia that afflicts young children , missing teeth , several forms of vision and hearing impairments and early-onset alzheimer's .
about 200,000 americans suffer from early-onset alzheimer's , accounting for 5 % of alzheimer's patients in the entire united states .
humans have a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes .
in the past three years , the sequencing of three chromosomes has been completed , including chromosomes 20 , 21 , and 22 .
