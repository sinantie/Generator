scientists decrypted the sequence of a chromosome crucial to symptoms of early disorders
( agence france-presse , paris , 2nd ) - an international consortium of scientists said that they have decrypted the sequence of the fourteenth pair of human chromosome , which is linked to a broad range of diseases , including an early onset of alzheimer that can strike people in their 30s .
this is the fourth chromosome to be fully sequenced up till now and it comprises of over 87 million pairs of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) .
the research , which was published in the weekly british science journal nature , said the sequence of chromosome 14 is made up by 1,050 genes and gene fragments .
the goal of gene scientists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify flawed genes that cause illness , and ultimately to provide treatments , which can stop these genes from malfunctioning .
the international consortium of scientists led by french gene research center genoscope said chromosome 14 has two clusters of genes , which are vital for the immune system , as well as more than 60 disease genes .
chromosome 14 has been identified in a wide range of diseases during previous studies , which include a form of spastic paraplegia that strikes young children ; missing teeth ; several kinds of vision and hearing impairments ; and early onset of alzheimer disease .
around 200,000 americans have early onset of alzheimer disease , which accounted for five percent of all alzheimer sufferers in america .
human beings have 23 sets of chromosomes .
in the past three years , three other chromosomes have been fully sequenced and they are pair 20 , 21 and 22 .
